				<h1>Dottify.me Privacy Policy</h1>
				<i>Revised January 3, 2014</i><br/><br/>
				Dottify.me is a public project for the Transgender/Transsexual and Gender Variant communities.  As members of this community, we understand the substantial concerns of members of our community about privacy, security and confidentiality. In our design, implementation and management of the application and the content it collects, we will always do our utmost to ensure that the trust placed in us is well founded.
				<br/><br/>
				Dottify.me is a tool to facilitate research for the Trans* and Gender Non-conforming communities. It is an open-source and open knowledge based project and
				will likely allow validated and verified members to collect data for beneficial research purposes.  However the principles of user control over matters of privacy and disclosure 
				will be enforced as a baseline to ensure that the fundamental contract between users and researchers is always respected.
				Dottify.me may publish results collected from the site, in various digital and/or non-digital formats,. In line with the policies below, any such publication will only be statistical in nature and any individually identifying data or data combinations will not be publicly published.				
				<br/><br/>
				
				If you become aware any security breaches or vulnerabilities in the application or site or have suggestions for enhanced security measures or policies, please contact <a href="mailto:admin@dottify.org">admin@dottify.org</a>.
